                The Office of Inspector General (OIG) serves as a watchdog
                agency for the WAX Network. It acts as a neutral third-party
                designated to evaluate WAX Guild Candidatesâ€™ contribution to the
                ecosystem and provide ongoing transparency for the community.
                The Office of Inspector General is a committee with three
                members who standardize WAX Guild evaluations and properly
                recognize WAX Guild Candidates making valuable contributions to
                the WAX ecosystem. The committee members (IGs) are elected
                individually from and by the community, contributing to further
                decentralizing the WAX Network.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-8">
                The IGs collaborate to handle the responsibilities of the
                office, issuing detailed criteria, evaluation parameters,
                scoring mechanisms, and more.

                The mission of the inspector general is to provide quantitative
                and qualitative assessments of WAX Guild Candidates on a
