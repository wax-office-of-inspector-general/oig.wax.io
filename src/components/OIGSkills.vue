                To effectively serve in the Office of Inspector General,
                technical proficiency is required. While IGs can acquire skills
                on the job and work collaboratively, each IG must take on
                specific tasks and responsibilities. The areas that IGs must
                cover include:

              <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-4">
                <li>
                  Communication — Fluency in English is essential for both
                  internal and external communication.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Proactivity — Each IG must be self-motivated and actively
                  engage in tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Blockchain Governance — Understanding how Blockchain
                  ecosystems and communities function is crucial for taking on a
                  leadership role in the ecosystem.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Project Management — Managing internal projects or overseeing
                  Guild Candidate contributions is key.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vision — Understanding where the ecosystem is heading and
                  knowing its needs and shortcomings is vital to enhancing
                  guidelines and integrations. The Guidelines steer the
                  direction Guilds contribute and build toward. Evaluating
                  existing contributions often requires seeing the broader
                  picture.

                <li>
                  Development — The OIG must have the ability to develop its own
                  tools and solutions, which requires an understanding of
                  design, smart contracts, front-end development, and back-end
                  solutions. Knowledge of development flows, an understanding of
                  smart contracts, and the ability to read source code are also
                  required to properly evaluate Guild Candidate submissions and
                  track progress throughout project lifecycles, as well as
                  assess the needs of the community and developers joining the
                  ecosystem.
                </li>
                <li>
                  DevOps and OpSec — As the OIG is self-sustained, it must be
                  able to act autonomously.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Poise — Whether it be heated internal discussions or external
                  communication, being an IG means staying level-headed and
                  expressing one’s standpoint clearly, even when attacked, while
                  at the same time evaluating the attacker without bias.
