                In the WAX Community, the selection of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is conducted through a transparent and structured process. This process unfolds in the following steps:

                  Elections are held every six months, with each Inspector General serving an 18-month term.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As soon as a new IG is elected, the previous IGâ€™s tenure ends and they are rotated out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The rotation of OIG seats takes place on the first day of February and August every year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The OIG is compensated in WAX Tokens and their salary is paid out of the WAX Worker Proposal fund.
